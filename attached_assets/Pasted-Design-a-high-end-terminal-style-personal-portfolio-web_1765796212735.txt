Design a high-end, terminal-style personal portfolio website for a software engineer with a strong AI/ML focus.

Core concept

Dark, cyberpunk-inspired terminal UI (black background, green accent text).

Command-line interaction as the primary navigation (help, about, projects, skills, experience, education, certifications, leadership, contact, clear).

Instant typing animations with smooth, non-distracting transitions.

Professional, recruiter-friendly content behind a creative interface.

Layout

Left panel (side image section):

A monochrome professional portrait displayed as a floating card.

Subtle glow or border using the primary accent color.

Interactive 3D tilt / parallax effect on cursor movement.

Image is clickable:

Default click → runs about

Hover tooltip → “Name · Software Engineer · AI Enthusiast”

Image changes contextually:

projects → project preview collage or animated thumbnails

experience → minimal timeline-style visual

contact → QR code + social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email)

Right panel (terminal):

Fully interactive terminal with a blinking cursor.

Command auto-suggestions for first-time users.

Clickable command shortcuts at the top for accessibility.

Smooth scroll and command history support.

Content behavior

projects:
Show 3–5 flagship projects with:

One-line problem statement

Tech stack

Impact/results

GitHub + Live demo links

skills: Grouped by categories (Languages, Frameworks, AI/ML, Tools).

experience: Clear role → responsibility → outcome format.

contact: One-command access to email, LinkedIn, GitHub (copy-to-clipboard support).

UX & accessibility

Mobile-responsive fallback:

Toggle to a non-terminal, card-based view.

High contrast, readable font sizes.

Keyboard-only navigation support.

Fast load, optimized images, lazy loading.

Visual polish

Subtle scanline or CRT effect (very light).

Soft terminal glow, no harsh animations.

Professional, brand-level finish comparable to top tech portfolios.

Goal
Create a portfolio that immediately signals technical depth, creativity, and senior-level thinking, while remaining clear, usable, and recruiter-friendly.
